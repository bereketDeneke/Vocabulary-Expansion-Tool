# Ethical Considerations for Web Scraping

## Overview
This project, **Vocabulary Expansion Tool**, makes use of web scraping to collect synonyms and antonyms from the Merriam-Webster website.

## Purpose of Data Collection
The primary goal of collecting data is to help users improve their vocabulary. This tool offers alternative word suggestions by retrieving synonyms and antonyms from a trusted source. The collected data is strictly for educational and research purposes, aiming to enhance communication skills without infringing on the rights or interests of others.

### Why Are We Collecting This Data?
We collect synonyms and antonyms to:
- Provide users with a variety of word choices to expand their vocabulary.
- Develop an engaging, interactive quiz to enhance learning through practice.
- Ensure the data is accurate, relevant, and easy to understand.

## Data Sources and Robots.txt Compliance
The **Merriam-Webster** website was selected due to its reputable and reliable thesaurus data. This tool adheres to ethical scraping practices by ensuring it respects the website's `robots.txt` file.

### Respecting Robots.txt
- Merriam-Webster’s `robots.txt` page does not explicitly prohibit the scraping of its thesaurus content.

## Collection Practices
When scraping data, the following practices are observed to minimize the impact on the website:

1. **Limiting Scraping Frequency**: The program makes only one request per word lookup to avoid overloading the website’s servers.
2. **No Bypassing of Protections**: The tool does not attempt to bypass any login, CAPTCHA, or other forms of access protection.
3. **Transparency**: Users are informed that the data is retrieved from Merriam-Webster, maintaining full transparency about the data source.

## Data Handling and Privacy
This project does **not collect any personally identifiable information (PII)** from users or the website being scraped. All data gathered is related solely to words, synonyms, and antonyms.

- **Data Storage**: If data storage becomes necessary, it will be done securely. Sensitive information, if ever included in future iterations (e.g., API keys), will be stored in a separate file (e.g., `.env` or `.gitignore`) to ensure privacy.
  
## Data Usage
The scraped data is used solely for **non-commercial, educational, and research purposes**. Users of this tool are encouraged to respect the same principles and avoid using this tool for commercial gain or purposes that may violate the source’s terms of use.

## Conclusion
We have taken care to follow ethical standards when developing this web scraper. The project does not scrape prohibited areas, respects the rules outlined in robots.txt, and limits requests to minimize disruption. By focusing on educational purposes and avoiding the collection of any PII, we aim to contribute to learning in a responsible and respectful manner.
